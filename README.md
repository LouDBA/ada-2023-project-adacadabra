# Decoding YouTube's Collaboration Web
## Introduction
How are YouTube channels interconnected, and what does this connectivity indicate about their influence and reach? With the expansive 'YouNiverse' dataset as our foundation, we aim to dissect video metadata, especially descriptions, to identify mentions of other channels or explicit collaborations. However, mere mentions aren't the only indicators of influence. Viewer engagement metrics, such as views and likes, are crucial. By examining these alongside collaboration data, we can understand a channel's holistic influence. Additionally, by leveraging the dataset's time series data, we'll track how influence shifts over time within each content category. Our goal is to offer a multi-dimensional perspective on YouTube's collaborative landscape, equipping creators with insights to foster collaborations that align with evolving viewer trends.

## How are YouTube channels interconnected, and what does this connectivity indicate about their influence and reach?

## Is there a difference in popularity between collaborating and non-collaborating channels? Is there a correlation between video frequency and views/subscriptions that could potentially bias the study?

## What is happening before and after collaborations? Is the number of viewers increasing? Can collaborations prolong the life of a channel?
